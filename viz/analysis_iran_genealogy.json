          "text": "I deliver this statement before the adoption of draft resolution III, under sub-item (c) of agenda item 71, entitled “Situation of human rights in the Islamic Republic of Iran. There is profound politicization in the international human rights regime, meaning that principled neutrality is sacrificed in favour of political discretion. Decisions to name and shame human-rights shortcomings do not reflect the principles of impartiality and objectivity, but rather the political interests of certain States. Supposedly, such universal principles are not principles at all, but rather vested interests masquerading as principles. My delegation vehemently rejects the so-called draft resolution on the situation of human rights in the Islamic Republic of Iran. Such a draft resolution is a fake plot intending to interfere in the internal affairs of an independent State under the pretense of promoting and protecting human rights. This lopsided draft resolution, which endorses the so-called fact- finding mission and the Special Rapporteur, is not recognized by my delegation, and it must be the highest priority of the Third Committee to get rid of it in any probable dialogue on the revitalization of its work. The penholder on the draft resolution and its allies force Member States to take sides against one another, and such division, led by Canada, is very dangerous to the cause of human rights. What we are witnessing now is tampering with delicate international human rights platforms in a dangerous manner. There are two simple questions before the General Assembly. Has this draft resolution contributed to the promotion of human rights in the country since it was first adopted? What kind of impact does a draft resolution that is not even circulated for negotiation have on the target country? The answer is none. Everything must have an objective. The objective of this draft resolution is, in essence, nothing, with no relevance to the promotion and protection of human rights. Therefore, it will not lead to any results. 23-41218 19/12/2023 Regrettably, an intergovernmental body, compromising all Member State representatives, is acting at the political behest of those specific States. Such extreme politicization may cause entities to lose credibility, become ineffective or even delegitimize their own process. In view of the fact that their supporters come from a European, anti-sovereign-State union, they cannot even reconsider such a political decision. They digest what is cooked in the kitchen of the European Union, with no autonomy to voice their opinions — an obvious dictatorship in the modern world. As of yet, Canada and its allies have not decided whether to raise their valid concerns with Iran respectfully and constructively. Over any given violation, those specific countries condemn adversaries while coddling friends, as we have witnessed in the case of another day of ground incursions and intense bombardment and invasion by the Israeli forces against civilians and civil and humanitarian infrastructure in Gaza. They see attacks against homes, hospitals, schools, shelters for the displaced, mosques, churches and even people who have no place but the open streets to live, but still try to shield that regime from accountability and shamelessly recognize Israel’s murderous campaign against Palestinian people under the guise of self-defence. History will record such neglect and selectivity. Resorting to two-State narratives must end. Negative cliches and accusations in addressing the situation of human rights in the Islamic Republic of Iran must end. The overgeneralization of a few cases while ignoring Iran’s outstanding human rights achievements must end. Iran will continue its engagement with other international human rights mechanisms, such as the Universal Periodic Review, thematic Special Rapporteurs, the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights and treaty bodies. In that regard, a number of programmes are on our agenda for the new year, including the visits of relevant human rights officials to Iran. Taking into account the clarification made, we urge Member States to oppose any kind of politicization and double standards by voting against the draft resolution on the situation of human rights in the Islamic Republic of Iran. Furthermore, while I have the floor, I would like to highlight a few points. Iran adheres to the principles of impartiality, objectivity and non-selectivity when it comes to considering human rights issues. In that vein, it is 23-41218 A/78/PV.50 our firm belief that the continuation of the practice of selectively adopting country-specific mandates, particularly in the Third Committee, and the exploitation of that platform for political ends contravenes those principles. My delegation will therefore disassociate itself from the consensus regarding the draft resolution on the situation of human rights in the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea and will vote against the draft resolution on the situation of human rights in the Syrian Arab Republic (draft resolution V). Mr. Kim Nam Hyok (Democratic People’s Republic of Korea): The delegation of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea strongly condemns and totally rejects draft resolution I, on the human rights situation in the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, submitted by the European Union, as a grave infringement upon the sovereignty of our State and a politically motivated, reckless provocation by hostile forces that aim to destroy our social system. The draft resolution is nothing but a document of political confrontation and fraud cooked up by the United States and its vassal forces, which persistently cling to the hostile policy of isolating and stifling the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, with their inveterate repugnance towards our ideas and system. As such, we do not see any merit in considering the draft resolution. Speaking explicitly once again, in our country there are none of the human rights issues touted by the United States and its vassal forces, or can such issues exist in the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, where the people-first policy is thoroughly implemented in overall State activities and social life and where the people actually enjoy their independent rights. Putting pressure on independent sovereign States that oppose the imperialists’ high-handedness and arbitrariness and violently interfering in the internal affairs of and overthrow the systems of those States under the pretext of human rights constitute the stereotypical method of the United States and its vassal forces. It is also clear that the aim of the forcible annual adoption of the anti-Democratic People’s Republic of Korea human rights draft resolution under the banner of the United Nations, pursued by the United States and hostile forces, is to politicize the non-existent human rights issues to the extreme and abuse the draft resolution as a mechanism for invading our State and as an instrument for interfering in our internal affairs in order to overthrow our system. The Democratic 27/34 A/78/PV.50 People’s Republic of Korea’s will is strong and clear: it will counter with the most powerful means the anti-Democratic People’s Republic of Korea human rights racket by the United States and the hostile forces, which totally deny the sovereignty of our State and its socialist system and grossly distort our people’s genuine enjoyment of human rights. To us, human rights mean precisely State sovereignty. The Democratic People’s Republic of Korea will do its utmost to defend its sovereignty and the genuine rights of the people against all despicable hostile acts by the United States and its vassal forces and will take the toughest counteraction to such anti-Democratic People’s Republic of Korea human rights smear campaigns as the forcible adoption of this draft resolution. In conclusion, my delegation rejects and will vote against all country-specific human rights draft resolutions against the Russian Federation, the Syrian Arab Republic and the Islamic Republic of Iran, proceeding from its principled position against the politicization, selectivity and double standards vis-à-vis human rights. Ms. Zabolotskaya (Russian Federation) (spoke in Russian): We would like to reiterate our position on the country-specific draft resolutions submitted at this meeting. Russia does not support the practice of considering selective and unilateral draft resolutions on human rights situations in individual countries. Such draft resolutions have little to do with the reality of the situation in the countries concerned and spread unsubstantiated and false accusations. We believe that such working methods are ineffective, create confrontation among Member States and delegitimize the United Nations as a platform for advocating human rights, based on the principle of the sovereign equality of States. We will vote against the draft resolutions III and V, on the human rights situation in Iran and Syria, respectively, and we will disassociate ourselves from the consensus on draft resolutions I and II, human rights situation in the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea and Myanmar, respectively. As for draft resolution IV, purportedly on the human rights in the temporarily occupied territories of Ukraine, it has nothing to do with either human rights or a grounding in reality. The geographical scope of the annual draft resolution has been broadened this year. It mentions various Russian regions — the Republic of Crimea, the Donetsk People’s Republic, the Luhansk 28/34 19/12/2023 People’s Republic and the Kherson and Zaporizhzhya regions. But there can be no talk of any human rights violations in those regions, because they are part of the political, legal and economic sphere of the Russian Federation. All those living in the Donetsk People’s Republic, the Luhansk People’s Republic and the Kherson and Zaporizhzhya regions are guaranteed the enjoyment of their human rights under the Constitution of the Russian Federation. Russia protects the people residing in those territories. Kyiv and its Western sponsors see the draft resolution as giving licence to engage in armed escalation and fratricidal conflict, while encouraging the commission of further crimes and fuelling crises. Ukraine attempts to appear as though it cares about human rights in those territories. However, the truth is that the Ukraine is trying to pass off the evacuation of children from the line of fire as crimes, while escalating the attacks against the Donetsk and Luhansk People’s Republics and the Zaporizhzhya and Kherson regions, as a result of which children and others are being killed. The Ukrainian armed forces carry out attacks on civilians on a daily basis, resulting in death and injury of civilians. Of course, the Kyiv regime is also silent about the fact that they have attempted to impose a water and food blockade of Crimea. They have recently turned to striking the peninsula and have attempted to destroy the Crimean bridge. Such inexplicable cruelty towards their compatriots is emblematic of the Kyiv regime, the ideology of which is a combination of hatred and racism. Kyiv’s goal is to continue its misanthropic policy aimed at destroying everything Russian in Ukraine, oppressing the Russian-speaking population and erasing all traces of Russian identity in the country. As an illustration of the latter, the representative of Ukraine will speak in any language other than Russian at the General Assembly, as he is afraid to use the Russian language out of fear of his own Government’s reprisals. Draft resolution IV is an obstacle to the peaceful resolution of the conflict. Russia will vote against the draft resolution, which serves to escalate the crisis, against impunity for the Kyiv regime and the continued mass-scale human rights violations in Ukraine. We call on everyone to do the same. Mr. Al Nahhas (Syrian Arab Republic) (spoke in Arabic): Draft resolution I, entitled “Situation of human rights in the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea”, targets a sovereign State under the pretext of defending human rights, which has become a 23-41218 19/12/2023 politicized tool employed by certain States to attack and change political regimes throughout the world. Any Government that exercises its rights and defends the rights of its people to sovereignty, independence and dignity in a way that displeases certain well-known Western countries will automatically be placed into the group of countries that violate human rights. That is why my country dissociates itself from the consensus on that draft resolution and will vote against all draft resolutions that target specific countries. We reiterate our position of rejecting politicizing human rights issues with the aim to interfere in the internal affairs of countries.",
